### Creating a New Project with [React-Solution](http://react-solution.pro)

In the command line, navigate to the directory where you want to create a new project and run the following command:

```sh
npm create react-solution@latest
```

This command will generate the initial structure of a React project using the [React-Solution](http://react-solution.pro) framework. The project comes with preconfigured tools, including Vite, TypeScript, Jest, ESLint, and Prettier. Configuration files for all tools will be located in the root directory of the project.
